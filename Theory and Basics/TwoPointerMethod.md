# üéØ Two-Pointer Approach ‚Äî Explained Like a Fun Game

Imagine you have two friends, **Lefty** and **Righty**, playing on a line of toys (an array).  
They both want to move around to find or fix things quickly.

---

## When to use two pointers?

- When you want to process elements from **two directions** (start and end).  
- When you want to **remove or rearrange elements in-place** without extra space.  
- When you want to **merge or compare sorted lists/arrays**.  
- When you want to **find pairs or subarrays** meeting some condition.

## 1. Two-pointer games: For loop vs While loop

### The ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop game (Known steps)

- Lefty starts at the beginning (index 0).  
- Righty starts at the end (index n-1).  
- They both know exactly how many steps to take.  
- Each step, Lefty moves right by 1, Righty moves left by 1.  
- They stop when they meet in the middle.

**Example:** Reverse an array or check if it's a palindrome.

```java
for (int i = 0, j = arr.length - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
    // Compare or swap arr[i] and arr[j]
}
```

---

### The ‚Äúwhile‚Äù loop game (Unknown steps)

- Lefty and Righty start somewhere.  
- They don‚Äôt know how many steps until a condition is met.  
- Depending on what they see (like toys to move), they decide who moves.  
- They keep going until they meet or some condition stops them.

**Example:** Move all zeros to end, remove elements, or partition an array.

```java
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    if (condition) left++;
    else right--;
}
```

---

## 2. When to start pointers at same place or at different places?

| Scenario                                       | Pointer Start Position      | Example Use Case                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Start at both ends (i = 0, j = n-1)             | Compare or swap elements from both sides | Palindrome check, reverse array, two sum in sorted array |
| Start both from beginning, offset one pointer    | (i = 0, j = i + 1)         | Scanning pairs, sliding window, removing duplicates |
| Start both at the beginning (i = 0, j = 0)       | Read-write pattern         | Remove elements, compress array                   |

---

## 3. Common patterns in-place array manipulation

### Pattern 1: Read-Write (Slow-Fast Pointer)

- **Idea:** One pointer scans every element (`j`), another writes only valid elements (`i`).  
- **Use:** Remove elements, deduplicate, filter.  
- **Order matters:** Keeps the order stable.

```java
int i = 0; // write pointer
for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) { // read pointer
    if (arr[j] != valToRemove) {
        arr[i] = arr[j]; // overwrite valid element
        i++;
    }
}
// Now first i elements are valid, rest can be ignored
```

---

### Pattern 2: Overwrite with last element (Swap and shrink)

- **Idea:** When order does **not** matter, swap unwanted element with the last one, and reduce size.  
- **Use:** Quick removal when order doesn't matter.

```java
int i = 0;
int n = arr.length;
while (i < n) {
    if (arr[i] == valToRemove) {
        arr[i] = arr[n - 1]; // swap with last
        n--; // shrink size
    } else {
        i++;
    }
}
```

- Efficient because no shifting needed.  
- But order changes.

---

### Pattern 3: Two pointers from both ends to partition (like QuickSort partition)

- Separate elements based on a condition.  
- Left pointer moves forward, Right pointer moves backward.  
- Swap elements out of place.

**Example:** Move all even numbers to the left, odd to the right.

```java
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    while (left < right && arr[left] % 2 == 0) left++;
    while (left < right && arr[right] % 2 == 1) right--;
    if (left < right) {
        swap(arr, left, right);
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```

## 4. Tips to avoid mistakes

- Don‚Äôt nest two two-pointer loops on the same array simultaneously ‚Äî one is usually enough.  
- Make sure pointers do **not cross** (`start < end` or `i < j`) to avoid infinite loops or invalid accesses.  
- Be careful updating pointers after swaps ‚Äî sometimes you must re-check the new element.  
- If order matters, don‚Äôt swap arbitrarily ‚Äî use the read-write pattern instead.  
- Initialize pointers carefully ‚Äî wrong start/end leads to bugs.  
- In while loops, ensure pointers move every iteration to avoid infinite loops.  
- Remember to use `i + 1` or `j - 1` when comparing pairs to avoid out-of-bounds or double counting.

# 5. Two Pointers with Sorted Array ‚Äî Move Pointers Based on Comparison

---

## When to Use:
- You have a **sorted array**.
- You want to find pairs (or subarrays) that meet a certain condition (e.g., sum equals a target).
- You want to avoid nested loops with O(n¬≤) time complexity and instead achieve O(n).

---

## How It Works:
1. Start with **two pointers**:
   - `left` at the start of the array (`0`)
   - `right` at the end of the array (`n-1`)

2. Calculate the sum (or compare the values) at these pointers.

3. If the sum is **too small**, move the `left` pointer **right** (increment) to increase the sum.

4. If the sum is **too big**, move the `right` pointer **left** (decrement) to decrease the sum.

5. Keep moving pointers until:
   - They meet (cross each other), or
   - You find what you want (e.g., a pair with the target sum).

---

## Kid-Friendly Explanation:
Imagine **Lefty** and **Righty** are picking toys with points.

- Lefty picks a small-point toy from the start.
- Righty picks a big-point toy from the end.
- They add their toy points.

If the total is **less than 10**, Lefty says:  
> ‚ÄúI need a bigger toy!‚Äù  
and moves right to pick a bigger toy.

If the total is **more than 10**, Righty says:  
> ‚ÄúI need a smaller toy!‚Äù  
and moves left to pick a smaller toy.

They keep trying until they find the perfect pair or cross paths.

---

## Code Example: Two-Sum in Sorted Array

```java
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
int target = 10;

while (left < right) {
    int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
    if (sum == target) {
        System.out.println("Pair found: " + arr[left] + ", " + arr[right]);
        break; // or continue searching for more pairs
    } else if (sum < target) {
        left++;  // sum too small, move left pointer right to increase sum
    } else {
        right--; // sum too big, move right pointer left to decrease sum
    }
}

Why Is This Efficient?
Because the array is sorted, you know exactly how to adjust your pointers to get closer to the target.

No guessing or unnecessary scanning.

Runs in O(n) time instead of O(n¬≤).

# ‚úÖ Two-Pointer Pattern Decision Checklist + Flowchart

Master the Two-Pointer technique by asking the right questions and applying the best-fit strategy. This guide makes it super clear when and why to use:

- `i = 0, j = n - 1`
- `i = 0, j = i + 1`
- `i = 0, j = 0`
- Read/Write pointers
- Sliding Window
- And more!

## üîç Step-by-Step Checklist

### üîπ Q1: Is the array **sorted**?

- **YES** ‚Üí Go to Q2  
- **NO** ‚Üí Go to Q4  

---

### üîπ Q2: Are you looking for a pair with a specific **sum or difference**?

- **YES** ‚Üí Use `i = 0`, `j = n - 1`

  - Move `i++` if sum is too **small**  
  - Move `j--` if sum is too **big**  

  ‚úÖ Classic sorted array **two-sum**

- **NO** ‚Üí Go to Q3

---

### üîπ Q3: Are you **removing duplicates** or filtering sorted elements?

- **YES** ‚Üí Use **Read-Write** pointer pattern  
  `i` = slow writer, `j` = fast reader

```java
int i = 0;
for (int j = 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
    if (arr[j] != arr[i]) {
        i++;
        arr[i] = arr[j];
    }
}
NO ‚Üí Consider sliding window or merge techniques

üîπ Q4: Do you want to check ALL pairs or combinations?
YES ‚Üí Use i = 0, j = i + 1 (nested loop)

for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
        // Check arr[i] and arr[j]
    }
}

Q5: Are you building or validating a window/range of values?
YES ‚Üí Use Sliding Window

Start: i = 0, j = 0

Expand with j++, shrink with i++ as needed

int i = 0, sum = 0;
for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
    sum += arr[j];
    while (sum > target) {
        sum -= arr[i];
        i++;
    }
    if (sum == target) {
        // Found window from i to j
    }
}


 Q6: Do you want to rearrange/partition based on a condition?
YES ‚Üí Use i = 0, j = n - 1 with swapping

‚úÖ Like moving 0s to front, odds to back, etc.

int i = 0, j = arr.length - 1;
while (i < j) {
    if (conditionWrongAtI) {
        swap(arr, i, j);
        j--;
    } else {
        i++;
    }
}

         |                      |
   Yes ‚Üí i = 0, j = n-1    ‚Üí i = 0, j = i+1
         |
   No ‚Üí Is it filtering?
         |
   Yes ‚Üí Read/Write pattern
   No ‚Üí Sliding window or merge



## Bonus patterns & uses

- **Sliding Window:** two pointers moving forward to maintain a window meeting some condition.  
- **Merging sorted arrays:** two pointers start at beginning of both arrays and move forward.  
- **Finding pairs with sum X:** two pointers start at ends and move inward to find pairs summing to X.  
- **Cycle detection (Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare):** fast and slow pointers for linked lists or arrays.
