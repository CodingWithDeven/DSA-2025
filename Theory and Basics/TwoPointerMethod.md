# üéØ Two-Pointer Approach ‚Äî Explained Like a Fun Game

Imagine you have two friends, **Lefty** and **Righty**, playing on a line of toys (an array).  
They both want to move around to find or fix things quickly.

---

## When to use two pointers?

- When you want to process elements from **two directions** (start and end).  
- When you want to **remove or rearrange elements in-place** without extra space.  
- When you want to **merge or compare sorted lists/arrays**.  
- When you want to **find pairs or subarrays** meeting some condition.

## 1. Two-pointer games: For loop vs While loop

### The ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop game (Known steps)

- Lefty starts at the beginning (index 0).  
- Righty starts at the end (index n-1).  
- They both know exactly how many steps to take.  
- Each step, Lefty moves right by 1, Righty moves left by 1.  
- They stop when they meet in the middle.

**Example:** Reverse an array or check if it's a palindrome.

```java
for (int i = 0, j = arr.length - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
    // Compare or swap arr[i] and arr[j]
}
```

---

### The ‚Äúwhile‚Äù loop game (Unknown steps)

- Lefty and Righty start somewhere.  
- They don‚Äôt know how many steps until a condition is met.  
- Depending on what they see (like toys to move), they decide who moves.  
- They keep going until they meet or some condition stops them.

**Example:** Move all zeros to end, remove elements, or partition an array.

```java
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    if (condition) left++;
    else right--;
}
```

## 2. When to start pointers at same place or at different places?

| Scenario                                       | Pointer Start Position      | Example Use Case                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Start at both ends (i = 0, j = n-1)             | Compare or swap elements from both sides | Palindrome check, reverse array, two sum in sorted array |
| Start both from beginning, offset one pointer    | (i = 0, j = i + 1)         | Scanning pairs, sliding window, removing duplicates |
| Start both at the beginning (i = 0, j = 0)       | Read-write pattern         | Remove elements, compress array                   |

## 3. Common patterns in-place array manipulation

### Pattern 1: Read-Write (Slow-Fast Pointer)

- **Idea:** One pointer scans every element (`j`), another writes only valid elements (`i`).  
- **Use:** Remove elements, deduplicate, filter.  
- **Order matters:** Keeps the order stable.

```java
int i = 0; // write pointer
for (int j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) { // read pointer
    if (arr[j] != valToRemove) {
        arr[i] = arr[j]; // overwrite valid element
        i++;
    }
}
// Now first i elements are valid, rest can be ignored
```

---

### Pattern 2: Overwrite with last element (Swap and shrink)

- **Idea:** When order does **not** matter, swap unwanted element with the last one, and reduce size.  
- **Use:** Quick removal when order doesn't matter.

```java
int i = 0;
int n = arr.length;
while (i < n) {
    if (arr[i] == valToRemove) {
        arr[i] = arr[n - 1]; // swap with last
        n--; // shrink size
    } else {
        i++;
    }
}
```

- Efficient because no shifting needed.  
- But order changes.

---

### Pattern 3: Two pointers from both ends to partition (like QuickSort partition)

- Separate elements based on a condition.  
- Left pointer moves forward, Right pointer moves backward.  
- Swap elements out of place.

**Example:** Move all even numbers to the left, odd to the right.

```java
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    while (left < right && arr[left] % 2 == 0) left++;
    while (left < right && arr[right] % 2 == 1) right--;
    if (left < right) {
        swap(arr, left, right);
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```

## 4. Tips to avoid mistakes

- Don‚Äôt nest two two-pointer loops on the same array simultaneously ‚Äî one is usually enough.  
- Make sure pointers do **not cross** (`start < end` or `i < j`) to avoid infinite loops or invalid accesses.  
- Be careful updating pointers after swaps ‚Äî sometimes you must re-check the new element.  
- If order matters, don‚Äôt swap arbitrarily ‚Äî use the read-write pattern instead.  
- Initialize pointers carefully ‚Äî wrong start/end leads to bugs.  
- In while loops, ensure pointers move every iteration to avoid infinite loops.  
- Remember to use `i + 1` or `j - 1` when comparing pairs to avoid out-of-bounds or double counting.

## 5. Bonus patterns & uses

- **Sliding Window:** two pointers moving forward to maintain a window meeting some condition.  
- **Merging sorted arrays:** two pointers start at beginning of both arrays and move forward.  
- **Finding pairs with sum X:** two pointers start at ends and move inward to find pairs summing to X.  
- **Cycle detection (Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare):** fast and slow pointers for linked lists or arrays.

## Summary table for when to use what pointer start and loop type

| Use Case                          | Pointer Start          | Loop Type | Pointer Role                 | Order Important? |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Reverse array / Palindrome check | i = 0, j = n-1        | For loop  | i++ & j-- simultaneously     | Yes              |
| Remove elements / deduplicate     | i = 0 (write), j = 0 (read) | For loop  | j scans, i writes            | Yes              |
| Partition (order not important)  | i = 0, n = length     | While loop| i scans, swaps with n - 1    | No               |
| Move zeros / partition            | i = 0, j = n-1        | While loop| i and j move conditionally   | No or Yes        |
| Sliding window                   | start = 0, end = 0    | While/For | Both move forward            | Yes              |
| Merge sorted arrays              | i = 0, j = 0 (two arrays) | While loop| i and j move independently   | Yes              |
