# ðŸš€ Remove Element (Remove All Occurrences of a Value)

**Leetcode Link:** [Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

---

## ðŸ“œ Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` **in-place** such that the relative order of the elements may be changed.  
Return the number of elements in `nums` which are **not equal** to `val`.  
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

## ðŸ§  Intuition: The Toy Box Analogy

Imagine a box of toys with some broken toys marked as `val`.  
Your goal:

- Remove all broken toys  
- Keep only the good toys  
- Do this without needing a new box  

You will overwrite the broken toys by placing good toys in their place using **two pointers**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach: Two Pointers

We use:

- Pointer `i` as the **write pointer** (position where the next good toy should go)  
- Pointer `j` as the **read pointer** (scans every toy)

## ðŸ”¢ Java Code (with Explanation)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] nums = new int[n];

        // Input array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            nums[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        int val = sc.nextInt(); // value to remove

        int i = 0; // write pointer
        
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (nums[j] != val) {
                nums[i] = nums[j]; // copy good toy to the write position
                i++; // move write pointer forward
            }
        }

        // i is the count of elements not equal to val
        System.out.println(i);

        // (Optional) Print array after removing val, ignoring elements beyond i
        for (int k = 0; k < i; k++) {
            System.out.print(nums[k] + " ");
        }
    }
}
