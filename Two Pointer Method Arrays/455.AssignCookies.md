# üöÄ Assign Cookies to Children

---

## Leetcode Link:
[Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

---

## üìú Problem Statement
You have two integer arrays:
- `g` representing the **greed factors** of children.
- `s` representing the **sizes of cookies** available.

Each child can be content if they receive a cookie with size **greater than or equal to** their greed factor.

Goal: Maximize the number of content children by assigning **at most one cookie per child**.

---

## üß™ Examples:

Input:

g = [1, 2, 3], s = [1, 1]

Output:

1

Explanation: Only one child (with greed 1) can be satisfied with a cookie size 1.

---

Input:

g = [1, 2], s = [1, 2, 3]

Output:

2

Explanation: Both children can be satisfied with cookies sized 1 and 2.

## üß† Intuition: The Candy Sharing Analogy

- Imagine `g` as children, each needing a minimum candy size to be happy (their greed factor).
- `s` is the pile of different candy sizes you have.
- You want to distribute candies so:
  - Each child gets **at most one** candy.
  - The candy is **big enough** to satisfy the child's greed.
  - You maximize the total number of happy children.

## üí° Approach: Two Pointers on Sorted Arrays

- Use two pointers:
  - `i` to track the current child in greed array `g`.
  - `j` to track the current cookie size in array `s`.
  
- Sort both arrays so you assign the **smallest cookie possible** that satisfies the smallest greedy child.
  
- Traverse both arrays:
  - If `s[j] >= g[i]` (cookie is enough for the child):
    - Assign cookie to child.
    - Increment both pointers and increase satisfied count.
  - Else:
    - Cookie too small, try bigger cookie by incrementing `j` only.

- Return the total count of satisfied children.

## üî¢ Java Code (with Explanation)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Read greed factors array (children)
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] g = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) g[i] = sc.nextInt();

        // Read cookie sizes array
        int m = sc.nextInt();
        int[] s = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) s[i] = sc.nextInt();

        Main ma = new Main();
        System.out.println(ma.findContentChildren(g, s));
    }

    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        int count = 0;  // Number of satisfied children
        int i = 0, j = 0;  // Pointers for children and cookies

        // Sort both arrays
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);

        // Iterate while both arrays have elements
        while (i < g.length && j < s.length) {
            if (s[j] >= g[i]) {
                // Cookie s[j] satisfies child g[i]
                count++; // increment satisfied count
                i++;     // move to next child
                j++;     // move to next cookie
            } else {
                // Cookie too small, try bigger cookie
                j++;
            }
        }
        return count; // return max number of satisfied children
    }
}


üìå Key Observations
Sorting helps assign the smallest possible cookie to the least greedy child first.

Two pointers allow efficient matching without nested loops.

Only move to the next child when the current child is satisfied.

‚è± Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n log n + m log m) due to sorting both arrays.

Space Complexity: O(1) extra space aside from input storage.
