# 🚀 Move Even Numbers to the Front of Array

---

## 📜 Problem Statement
Given an integer array, rearrange the array **in-place** so that all even numbers appear before all odd numbers.

The **relative order** among even or odd numbers does **not** need to be maintained.

---

## 🧪 Examples

Input:
[3, 8, 5, 6, 2, 1]


Output (one possible):
[8, 6, 2, 5, 3, 1]

## 🧠 Intuition: The Partitioning Plate Analogy

Imagine a plate with mixed fruits — apples and oranges. Your goal is to move all apples to the left side and all oranges to the right side.

You don’t care about the order inside apples or oranges, only that apples come before oranges.

To do this efficiently **in-place**, use two pointers:

- One pointer tracks the next position to place an apple (even number).
- The other pointer scans through the plate.

When you find an apple (even number) on the right side, swap it with the orange (odd number) on the left side.

## 💡 Approach: Two-Pointers to Partition Even and Odd

- Use two pointers:
  - `i` points to where the next even number should be placed.
  - `j` scans each element in the array.

- Traverse the array with `j`:
  - If `arr[j]` is even, swap it with `arr[i]` and increment `i`.
  - If odd, just continue scanning by incrementing `j`.

- After one pass, all even numbers are grouped at the front, odds at the back.

## 🔢 Java Code (with Explanation)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];

        // Input array elements
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) arr[k] = sc.nextInt();

        int i = 0;  // Pointer for placing even numbers
        int j = 0;  // Scanning pointer

        // Loop through the array
        while (j < arr.length) {
            if (arr[j] % 2 == 0) {
                // Swap even element to the front
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;

                i++;    // Move even placement pointer forward
            }
            j++;  // Always move scanning pointer forward
        }

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
}

## 📌 Key Observations
Start both pointers i and j at 0 to check every element.

Whenever an even number is found at j, swap it with the element at i.

Increment i only when you place an even number, so i always points to the next place for an even number.

This is an in-place partition — no extra arrays or lists needed.

Works even for edge cases like [0], [0,1], or arrays with no evens or all evens.

⏱ Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) — Single pass through the array.

Space Complexity: O(1) — In-place swapping, no extra space used.
